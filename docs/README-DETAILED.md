# BluOS Controller - Detailed Documentation

> **Note**: This is the detailed documentation. For a quick start guide, see the [main README.md](../README.md).

A production-ready, unified command-line controller for BluOS devices on macOS.

Current line: multi-zone discovery (`ip:port`, `_musc` + `_musp` for CI secondary zones). Released version is tagged; see [CHANGELOG.md](../CHANGELOG.md).

## Features

### Device Discovery

**Dual Discovery Protocol Support:**
- **mDNS (Bonjour)**: Default discovery method using macOS native `dns-sd`. Browses `_musc._tcp` (primary players) and `_musp._tcp` (CI secondary zones such as NAD CI S2) and keeps the SRV port.
- **LSDP (Lenbrook Service Discovery Protocol)**: Alternative discovery using UDP broadcast on port 11430. More reliable on networks with multicast issues. Discovers chassis IPs only (normalized to `ip:11000`); use mDNS for secondary zones.
- **Hybrid Mode**: Configure `DISCOVERY_METHOD=both` to try mDNS first, automatically fallback to LSDP if no devices found.

**Discovery Features:**
- Players keyed as canonical `ip:port` (primary `11000`, CI zones `11010+`)
- `/SyncStatus` verification before writing the discovery cache
- Configurable discovery timeout (default: 5 seconds)
- Intelligent caching with TTL (default: 300 seconds) to reduce network traffic
- IP/endpoint validation and sanitization (rejects loopback, multicast, reserved, and link-local addresses)
- Support for BluOS Players, Servers, Hubs, and CI multi-zone secondary endpoints

### Status Monitoring

**Comprehensive Device Information:**
- Device name, model, brand, and firmware version
- Current playback state (play, pause, stop, stream, connecting)
- Volume level and mute status
- Currently playing track (title, artist, album)
- Active service/input source
- Battery level (for portable devices)
- System uptime from device diagnostics
- Sync group information (master/slave relationships)

**Network Statistics (with UniFi Integration):**
- Wired/WiFi connection status
- Uplink information (switch/AP name, port)
- Network throughput (down/up totals and rates)
- Connection uptime
- RSSI signal strength for WiFi devices

**Output Formats:**
- Human-readable formatted output with color coding
- JSON output mode for scripting and automation
- Filterable by device name pattern

### Volume Control

**Multi-Device Support:**
- Control all devices simultaneously (default)
- Target specific devices by name
- Pattern matching for multiple devices (e.g., "Room" matches "Living Room", "Bedroom")

**Volume Operations:**
- Set absolute volume (0-100%)
- Increment/decrement volume (+/- values)
- Mute/unmute individual or all devices
- Reset to configurable safe volume level
- Real-time volume display with status indicators

### Playback Control

**Full Playback Management:**
- Play/resume playback on all or selected devices
- Pause playback (individual or all devices)
- Stop playback completely
- Skip to next track
- Go to previous track
- Toggle play/pause state (intelligently switches based on current state)

**Multi-Device Operations:**
- All commands support operating on all devices, specific devices, or pattern-matched devices
- Concurrent execution using thread pools for fast multi-device control
- Status feedback for each device operation

### Queue Management

**Queue Operations:**
- View current playback queue with track information (title, artist, album, service)
- Clear queue on all or selected devices
- Reorder tracks by moving items within queue
- Queue information includes track count and metadata

### Input Source Selection

**Audio Input Control:**

### Sync Group Management

**Multi-Room Synchronization (runtime groups):**
- Create sync groups with a primary player and one or more slaves
- Uses BluOS `AddSlave` / `RemoveSlave` on the primary (not legacy `/Sync`)
- Break sync groups by removing slaves from the primary
- List groups with primary/slave relationships and combined group names
- Parses `/SyncStatus` for `group`, `<master>`, and `<slave>` elements
- Devices in sync groups automatically follow primary playback

**Example output (`sync list`):**

```text
Group: Living Room Speakers + 1 slave
  Primary: Living Room Speakers (172.16.10.174)
  Slave:   Kitchen Speakers (172.16.10.88)

Standalone:
  Patio Speakers (172.16.10.90)
```

**Example output (`status`, grouped primary with 7 slaves):**

```text
[1] Living Room Speakers
    Status: ★ PRIMARY  |  Vol: 10%  |  Source: Tidal
    Sync:   6 slaves
    ♫ Track:  Hayling
```

## Installation

### Quick Install

Run the installation script from the repository:

```bash
# from the cloned repo
./install.sh
```

The script will:
- Copy files to `~/.config/bluos-controller`
- Prompt for configuration settings (UniFi integration, etc.)
- Create `config.json` with your settings
- Create a symlink `~/local/bin/bluos-controller` (add to PATH if needed)

### Manual Installation

1. Clone or copy this repository to `~/.config/bluos-controller`
2. Ensure Python 3.10+ is installed
3. Make `main.py` executable: `chmod +x main.py`
4. Create `config.json` (see Configuration section)

## Configuration

Configuration is stored in `~/.config/bluos-controller/config.json` (JSON format is preferred, but INI format is also supported for backward compatibility).

### Basic Configuration

```json
{
  "DISCOVERY_METHOD": "mdns",
  "DISCOVERY_TIMEOUT": "5",
  "CACHE_TTL": "300",
  "DEFAULT_SAFE_VOL": "14",
  "UNIFI_ENABLED": "false",
  "UNIFI_CONTROLLER": "",
  "UNIFI_API_KEY": "",
  "UNIFI_SITE": "default"
}
```

**Discovery Methods:**
- `mdns` - mDNS/Bonjour discovery (default, recommended); always browses `_musc._tcp` and `_musp._tcp`
- `lsdp` - LSDP (Lenbrook Service Discovery Protocol) - more reliable on networks with multicast issues; primary port only
- `both` - Try mDNS first, fallback to LSDP if no devices found

`BLUOS_SERVICE` may still appear in older configs; discovery ignores it and uses the built-in dual-service browse list.

### UniFi Integration (Optional)

To enable UniFi integration for network statistics, set:

```json
{
  "UNIFI_ENABLED": "true",
  "UNIFI_CONTROLLER": "your-controller.local",
  "UNIFI_API_KEY": "your-api-key",
  "UNIFI_SITE": "default"
}
```

#### Secure API Key Storage (macOS Keychain)

**Recommended**: Store your UniFi API key securely in macOS Keychain instead of plaintext in `config.json`:

```bash
# Store API key in Keychain
bluos-controller keychain set

# Check if API key is stored
bluos-controller keychain get

# Remove API key from Keychain
bluos-controller keychain delete
```

**How it works:**
- The `keychain set` command prompts for your API key and stores it securely in macOS Keychain
- When the controller needs the API key, it checks Keychain first, then falls back to `config.json`
- Keychain values take precedence over `config.json` entries
- If you store the key in Keychain, you can leave `UNIFI_API_KEY` empty in `config.json`

**Security Benefits:**
- ✅ API key stored in macOS Keychain (encrypted, system-managed)
- ✅ No plaintext API keys in config files
- ✅ Keychain access requires user authentication
- ✅ Backward compatible: existing `config.json` entries still work

**Note**: Keychain storage is only available on macOS. On other platforms, use `config.json`.

## Usage

After installation, use the `bluos-controller` command:

**Note**: Most commands support controlling all devices (default) or specific devices by name. Device names can be:
- Exact match: `"Living Room"`
- Partial match: `"Room"` matches "Living Room", "Bedroom", etc.
- Case-insensitive matching

### Discover Devices

```bash
bluos-controller discover
```

### Status Report

```bash
# All devices
bluos-controller status

# Filter by name
bluos-controller status "Living Room"

# Force fresh scan
bluos-controller status --scan

# JSON output
bluos-controller status --json
```

### Volume Control

```bash
# List current volumes
bluos-controller volume

# Set absolute volume
bluos-controller volume 20

# Adjust volume
bluos-controller volume +5
bluos-controller volume -10

# Mute/Unmute
bluos-controller volume mute
bluos-controller volume unmute

# Reset to safe volume
bluos-controller volume reset

# Target specific device
bluos-controller volume 25 "Living Room"
```

### Playback Control

All playback commands support controlling all devices (default) or specific devices by name/pattern:

```bash
# All devices (default)
bluos-controller play
bluos-controller pause
bluos-controller stop
bluos-controller skip
bluos-controller previous
bluos-controller toggle

# Specific device
bluos-controller play "Living Room"
bluos-controller pause "Kitchen"

# Pattern matching (multiple devices)
bluos-controller play "Room"  # Matches "Living Room", "Bedroom", etc.
```

### Queue Management

Queue commands support all devices or specific devices:

```bash
# Show queue for all devices
bluos-controller queue

# Show queue for specific device
bluos-controller queue "Living Room"

# Clear queue on all devices
bluos-controller queue clear

# Clear queue on specific device
bluos-controller queue clear "Kitchen"

# Move track in queue (all or specific)
bluos-controller queue move 3 1          # All devices
bluos-controller queue move 3 1 "Living Room"  # Specific device
```

### Input Source Selection

Input commands support all devices or specific devices:

```bash
# List inputs for all devices
bluos-controller inputs

# List inputs for specific device
bluos-controller inputs "Living Room"

# Set input on all devices
bluos-controller inputs "" "Bluetooth"

# Set input on specific device
bluos-controller inputs "Living Room" "Bluetooth"
bluos-controller inputs "Kitchen" "Optical 1"
```

### Bluetooth Mode Control

Bluetooth commands support all devices or specific devices:

```bash
# Show Bluetooth mode for all devices
bluos-controller bluetooth

# Show mode for specific device
bluos-controller bluetooth "Living Room"

# Set mode on all devices
bluos-controller bluetooth "" auto

# Set mode on specific device
bluos-controller bluetooth "Living Room" manual
bluos-controller bluetooth "Kitchen" auto
bluos-controller bluetooth "Bedroom" guest
bluos-controller bluetooth "Office" disable
```

### Preset Management

Preset commands support all devices or specific devices:

```bash
# List presets for all devices
bluos-controller presets

# List presets for specific device
bluos-controller presets "Living Room"

# Play preset on all devices
bluos-controller presets "" 1

# Play preset on specific device
bluos-controller presets "Living Room" 1
```

### Sync Group Management

Runtime BluOS groups use the **primary** player to attach or detach slaves.

```bash
# Create sync group (Living Room primary, Kitchen + Bedroom slaves)
bluos-controller sync create "Living Room Speakers" "Kitchen Speakers,Bedroom Speakers"

# Break all runtime groups
bluos-controller sync break

# Refresh discovery, then list groups
bluos-controller sync list --scan

# Break groups involving a specific player (primary or slave)
bluos-controller sync break "Kitchen Speakers"

# List sync groups and standalone players
bluos-controller sync list
```

`sync list` reads `/SyncStatus` from each player and shows:

- Combined `group` name on the primary (same name Tidal Connect may advertise)
- Primary and slave IPs/names
- Standalone players not currently grouped

Ungrouping always sends `RemoveSlave` to the **primary**, matching BluOS runtime group behavior.

### Device Diagnostics

```bash
bluos-controller diagnose "Device Name"
```

### Keychain Management (macOS)

Manage UniFi API key storage in macOS Keychain:

```bash
# Store API key in Keychain (prompts for password)
bluos-controller keychain set

# Check API key status
bluos-controller keychain get

# Remove API key from Keychain
bluos-controller keychain delete
```

**Note**: Keychain operations are macOS-only and don't require network discovery, making them fast and efficient.

### Reboot Devices

Reboot commands support all devices or specific devices:

```bash
# Hard reboot all devices
bluos-controller reboot

# Hard reboot specific device
bluos-controller reboot "Living Room"

# Soft reboot all devices
bluos-controller reboot --soft

# Soft reboot specific device
bluos-controller reboot --soft "Kitchen"
```

## Debug Mode & Logging

### Debug Logging

Enable debug logging by setting the environment variable:

```bash
export BLUOS_DEBUG=1
bluos-controller status
```

Debug logs are written to `~/.config/bluos-controller/bluos-controller.log`

### Structured Logging (JSON Format)

Enable JSON-formatted structured logging for better log parsing and analysis:

```bash
export BLUOS_STRUCTURED_LOG=1
bluos-controller status
```

Structured logs include:
- Timestamp (ISO 8601 format)
- Log level (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR)
- Logger name and module information
- Function name and line number
- Custom fields (device IP, operation, etc.)
- Exception information (when applicable)

This format is ideal for log aggregation systems, monitoring tools, and automated analysis.

## Requirements

- **Python**: 3.10+ (uses only standard library - no external dependencies)
- **Operating System**: macOS (uses `dns-sd` and `dscacheutil` for mDNS discovery)
- **Network**: Access to BluOS devices on local network
- **Optional**: UniFi Controller (for network statistics integration)

## Environment Variables

- `BLUOS_DEBUG=1`: Enable debug logging
- `BLUOS_STRUCTURED_LOG=1`: Enable JSON structured logging format

## Troubleshooting

### Devices Not Found

1. **Check Network Connectivity**: Ensure devices are on the same network
2. **Try Different Discovery Method**: 
   ```bash
   # Edit ~/.config/bluos-controller/config.json
   # Change "DISCOVERY_METHOD" to "lsdp" or "both"
   ```
3. **Force Fresh Discovery**: Use `--scan` flag
   ```bash
   bluos-controller status --scan
   ```
4. **Check Firewall**: Ensure UDP port 11430 (LSDP) and mDNS are not blocked

### Network Errors

- **Timeout Errors**: Increase `DISCOVERY_TIMEOUT` in config (default: 5 seconds)
- **Connection Refused**: Verify device IP addresses are correct
- **Retry Logic**: Network operations automatically retry up to 3 times with exponential backoff

### UniFi Integration Issues

- **No Network Stats**: UniFi integration is optional - the controller continues without it
- **Check Config**: Verify `UNIFI_ENABLED=true` and API credentials are correct
- **Cache**: UniFi data is cached - use `--scan` to force refresh

### Performance Issues

- **Rate Limiting**: Operations are automatically rate-limited per device (0.1s minimum delay)
- **Concurrent Operations**: Discovery and status operations use thread pools for efficiency
- **Caching**: Discovery results are cached (default: 5 minutes) to reduce network traffic

### Logging

- **Debug Mode**: Set `BLUOS_DEBUG=1` for detailed logging
- **Structured Logs**: Set `BLUOS_STRUCTURED_LOG=1` for JSON-formatted logs
- **Log Location**: `~/.config/bluos-controller/bluos-controller.log`
